Future Backlog
>> create flask or TK config GUI for setup and settings changes. 

Second Sprint 10/15/25-ongoing
Primary Goal: Create setup files in order for user to create and configure database

Requirements:
1) Shell script to initialize databases on install
2) Use variables to make shell script configurable
3) Begin design of database structure
4) Allow databases to be named via variables
5) Keep in mind that config will eventually come from flask

First Sprint 10/12/25-10/15/25
Primary Goal: Basic functionality of Flask


Requirements:
1) HTML CSS Python handshake
2) Establish architecural principals and basic templates.
3) Flask should put up an index page showing a text box as well as feedback information boxes for when database returns information.
4) Create a python object which can hold the neccecary data to send to Flask
5) Keep in mind modularity and cross language configurability. 

Review:
1) Using Flask seems to be an effient way mostly due to Python's compatibilty with JSON. May require more complexity when intergrating POSTGRE
2) Created basic architecural plan in main.py. 
3) Created HTML and CSS templates. Using variables for CSS attributes was easier than expected. 
4) person.py created with outline of attributes needed from database
5) In order to configure as many settings that are required it looks like a second webpage or TK app may be needed to give user GUI configuration ADD to requirements
